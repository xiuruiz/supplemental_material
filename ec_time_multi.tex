\noindent To make Figure \arabic{counter},
run the nucleosynthesis calculations as done
\hyperlink{sec:single_zone}{previously} but for the four cases
1) {\em t9\_0} = 6 and {\rm rho\_0 = 2.e7},
2) {\em t9\_0} = 7 and {\rm rho\_0 = 3.4e7},
3) {\em t9\_0} = 8 and {\rm rho\_0 = 5.e7}, and
4) {\em t9\_0} = 7 and {\rm rho\_0 = 1.e7} (Run 2).
Then create the data as done
\hyperlink{sec:ec_time5}{previously}.
