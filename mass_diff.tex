\noindent To make Figure \arabic{counter}, it is necessary to retrieve the
relevant nuclear data.  First, create the {\em libnucnet} example codes by
typing
\begin{verbatim}
cd ~/projects/nucnet-tools-code/build

make -f Makefile.libnucnet all_libnucnet
\end{verbatim}
Next extract the data by typing
\begin{verbatim}
cd ../libnucnet

./print_nuclides ../data_pub/my_net.xml "[(z >= 12 and z <= 30) and ((a = 2 * z or a = 2 * z + 4) and z mod 2 = 0)]" > ../data_pub/coulomb/masses.txt
\end{verbatim}
The XPath expression selects out only alpha nuclei and their potential
daughters.  Graph the mass excess (column 4 of {\em masses.txt})
difference between $(Z,A)$ and $(Z-2,A)$ versus atomic number of the $(Z,A)$
parent (column 2).

Now compute the terms in the nuclear mass formula for the species by typing
\begin{verbatim}
cd ~/projects/nuclear_mass

./mass_terms ../nucnet-tools-code/data_pub/my_net.xml "[((z >= 12 and z <= 30) and ((a = 2 * z or a = 2 * z + 4) and z mod 2 = 0)) or a = 1]" > ../nucnet-tools-code/data_pub/coulomb/energies.txt
\end{verbatim}
The columns of the output file {\em energies.txt} are
1 (species name), 2 (atomic number), 3 (mass number), 4 (volume
energy), 5 (surface energy), 6 (Coulomb energy), 7 (pairing energy), and
8 (shell energy).  Subtract the relevant Coulomb energy from the mass excess
from {\em masses.txt} and plot the difference between $(Z,A)$ and $(Z-2,A)$
versus atomic number of the $(Z,A)$ parent.
