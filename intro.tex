\section*{Introduction}

This supplementary material explains in some detail how to create the figures 
in the parent paper.  We describe input files you need to edit and commands 
that you type to make the data for the figures.

\hspace{4ex}In what follows, you will need to type certain lines directly into 
your computer.  For example,
\begin{verbatim}
./command input1 input2
\end{verbatim}
means that you should enter {\bf ./command input1 input2} into your computer.  
We in fact recommend that you simply copy and paste such text (for example, try 
triple-clicking the line to select it) into the appropriate directory.
