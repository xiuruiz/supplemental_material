\section*{Computer Requirements}

\hspace{12ex}The calculations needed to create the figures can be run on most 
computers.  It is necessary to install the appropriate libraries, as described 
at \url{http://sourceforge.net/p/nucnet-projects/wiki/libraries/}.
Since the input and 
output XML data are parsed in with a DOM parser, it is advisable to have at 
least 2 Gb of RAM.
